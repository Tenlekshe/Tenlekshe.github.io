        <h2><strong>Steps Required</strong></h2>
        <ol><li>Mix the orange sauce ingredients and set aside.  Amanda strongly recommends double or tripling the orange sauce because it is amazing!</li>
            <li>Season the chicken lightly with salt and coat evenly with corn starch, set aside.</li>
            <li>Heat a wok or fry pan on high heat, add 1 teaspoon of sesame oil and add half of the chicken. If you don’t have sesame oil, that is ok! Just use a neutral oil like vegetable oil.  Cook 2 to 3 minutes on each side until well browned, set aside.</li>
            <li>Add 1 teaspoon of oil and chicken and repeat cooking 2 to 3 minutes on each side. Set aside with the rest of the chicken. 
</li>
            <li>Add remaining teaspoon of oil and quickly stir-fry the minced garlic and ginger until fragrant, about 1 minute.  Want to add veggies to this dish? See note below.
</li>
            <li>Add the orange zest then return the chicken to the pan.</li>
            <li>Quickly stir the chicken then add the orange sauce and cook until the sauce thickens, about 1 to 2 minutes.</li>
            <li>Divide between 4 plates and garnish with the scallion and sesame seeds.</li>

    <p class ="chai"><br><strong><em>VEGGIE NOTE:</em></strong><br> Do you like veggies? Add any stir fry veggies to your dish. It is recommended to fry up the veggies after the chicken has been cooked.  Remove the chicken from the wok or fry pan and stir fry your veggies using sesame oil or a neutral oil.  Add the chicken back to the fry pan with veggies and add in your orange sauce!</p>

        <h2><strong>Steps Required</strong></h2>
        <ol><li>Preheat oven to 400° F.</li>
            <li>Bring a large pot of salted water to a rapid boil. Add the gnocchi and broccoli and simmer for 3 minutes. Drain water and set aside.</li>
            <li>In a large oven proof skillet, bring the broth to a simmer. Add cream cheese, stirring until it’s mostly combined. Don’t worry if there are small pieces of cream cheese left, everything will come together when it bakes. Add one cup of the mozzarella cheese and stir until melted.</li>
            <li>Stir in the broccoli and gnocchi. Top with mozzarella and bake on the center rack for 15 minutes, or until the top is bubbly. Sprinkle with red pepper flakes and serve immediately.</li>
